Results from both conventional regression and\nvector autoregression (VAR) models show that the marginal cost of production\nplays an important role in explaining bitcoin prices, challenging recent\nallegations that bitcoins are essentially worthless. Even with markets pricing\nbitcoin in the thousands of dollars each, the valuation model seems robust.

Monitoring\nalgorithms for parametric trace slicing depend on garbage collection to (i)\ncleanup data-structures storing monitored objects, ensuring they do not become\nunmanageably large, and (ii) anticipate the violation of (non-safety)\nproperties that cannot be satisfied as a monitored object can no longer appear\nlater in the trace. The proposal is that both usages can be improved by making\nthe unreachability of monitored objects explicit",

Example\nNMR and MMR circuits were implemented using a 32/28nm CMOS process and\ncompared. The results show that MMR circuits dissipate less power, occupy less\narea, and encounter less critical path delay than the corresponding NMR\ncircuits while providing the same degree of fault tolerance. Hence the MMR is a\npromising alternative to the NMR to efficiently implement high levels of\nredundancy",

In this paper, we\nextend this result to the case of multiple cells in which a caching relay is\nshared among multiple non-cooperative base stations (BSs).

Among many pruning granularities, neuron level pruning will remove\nredundant neurons and filters in the model and result in thinner networks.

One is the Bootstrapped Selective\nPredictability Scheme (SPSb), which can provide quantitative forecasts of the\nGross Domestic Product of countries. The other, Hidden Markov Model (HMM)\nregularisation, denoises the datasets typically employed in the literature. We\ncontribute to EC along three different directions. First, we prove the\nconvergence of the SPSb algorithm to a well-known statistical learning\ntechnique known as Nadaraya-Watson Kernel regression. The latter has\nsignificantly lower time complexity, produces deterministic results, and it is\ninterchangeable with SPSb for",

Hence, failures became the norm rather\nthan the exception. Different approaches on high performance computing (HPC)\nsystems have been introduced, to prevent failures (e. g., redundancy) or at\nleast minimize their impacts (e. g., checkpoint and restart). In most cases,\nwhen these approaches are employed to increase the resilience of certain parts\nof a system, energy consumption rapidly increases, or performance significantly\ndegrades. To address this challenge, we propose on-demand resilience as an\napproach to achieve adaptive resilience in HPC systems.",

[SEP]   In a recent paper M. Lopez-Suarez, I. Neri, and L.

In order to develop an approach that is able to successfully\nfulfill this objective, there are two main challenges that ought to be\naddressed. The first challenge is to define the extent of the target area. An\nunsupervised machine learning approach is proposed to overcome this difficulty.\nThe second challenge is to correctly identify the main causes of\nvegetation-related outages and to thoroughly investigate their nature.
