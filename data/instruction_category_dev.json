Using the experimental\nresults and atomic simulations, the static and dynamic length scales were\ncalculated for several materials, zinc oxide (ZnO), silicon (Si), silicon\ncarbide (SiC), indium antimonide (InSb), and diamond. To evaluate the predicted\nstatic and dynamic length scales as well as the presented model, the natural\nfrequencies of a beam in addition to the phase velocity and group velocity of\nSi were studied and compared with the",

In\nactor-based systems, messages are exchanged concurrently but executed\nsequentially by the receiving actor. By relying on isolation and non-sharing,\nan actor can access its own state without fear of data-races, and the internal\nbehavior of an actor can be reasoned about sequentially.\nHowever, actor isolation is sometimes too strong to express useful patterns.\nFor example, letting the iterator of a data-collection alias the internal\nstructure of the collection allows a more efficient implementation than if each\naccess",

In this paper, we focus on\ndesigning index structures to expedite these spatial-visual searches. We start\nby baseline indexes that are straightforward extensions of the current popular\nspatial (R*-tree) and visual (LSH) index structures. Subsequently, we propose\nhybrid index structures that evaluate both spatial and visual features in\ntandem. The unique challenge of this type of query is that there are\ninaccuracies in both spatial and visual",

Although it seems to be\neffective for many different neural network training problems, it is unclear if\nthe effectiveness of gradient descent can be explained using existing\nperformance guarantees for the algorithm. We argue that existing analyses of\ngradient descent rely on assumptions that are too strong to be applicable in\nthe case of multi-layer neural networks. To address this, we propose an\nalgorithm, duality structure gradient descent (DSGD), that is amenable to a\nnon-asymptotic performance analysis, under mild assumptions on the",

Current implementations of vehicular radar devices,\nhowever, are expensive, use a substantial amount of bandwidth, and are\nsusceptible to multiple security risks. Consider the feasibility of using an\nIEEE 802.11 orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communications\nwaveform to perform radar functions. In this paper, we present an approach that\ndetermines the mean-normalized channel energy from frequency domain channel\nestimates and models it as a direct sinusoidal function of target range,\nenabling",

Algorithms, 1996] solves\nthe following problem in linear fixed-parameter time: given a tree\ndecomposition of a graph of (possibly suboptimal) width $k$, compute an\noptimum-width tree decomposition of the graph. In this work, we prove that this\nproblem can also be solved in MSO in the following sense: for every positive\ninteger $k$, there is an MSO transduction from tree decompositions of width $k$\nto tree decompositions of optimum width. Together with our recent results [LICS\n2016], this implies that for every $k$ there exists an MSO transduction which\ninputs a graph",

These codes are decoded with a recursive computation of the {\\em a\nposteriori} probabilities of the code symbols together with the Koetter-Vardy\nsoft decoder used for decoding the code components in polynomial time.

Planet formation with pebbles has been proposed to solve a couple of\nlong-standing issues in the classical formation model. Some sophisticated\nsimulations have been done to confirm the efficiency of pebble accretion.\nHowever, there has not been any global N-body simulations that compare the\noutcomes of planet formation via pebble accretion with observed extrasolar\nplanetary systems.

Consequently, the data processing power of the database system cannot be\nused anymore for this information, leading to constrained flexibility in the\ndefinition of mining patterns and limited execution performance in mining large\nlogs. Enabling process mining directly on a database - instead of via\nintermediate storage in a flat file - therefore provides additional flexibility\nand efficiency.

The proposed method is referred to as the cross-correlated CSI. It\nenables better robustness and higher inversion accuracy than both the classical\nCSI and multiplicative regularized CSI (MR-CSI). In addition, we show how the\ngradient of the modified cost functional can be calculated without\nsignificantly increasing the computational burden.
